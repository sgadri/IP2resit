        <center>Earthquakes</center>
    </h1>
     
      <p> The earthquakes are a result of the shaking of surface of the earth from a 
          sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere. The earthquakes are very
          common in certain places around the world and their instensity is usually 
          low so they don't threaten people's lives.
          But these earthquakes should be followed and monitored all the time.
          This data set shows some of latest earthquakes by storing the coordinates
          of the locations where earthquakes took place.
